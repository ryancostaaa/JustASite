             I am so blessed to have met you and can not wait to see what the future holds for us. You make me so happy and you are everything 
             I could ever wish for. Thank you for being you and being so incredible. I still remember geeking out waiting for you to fly in so 
             I could hear your voice and get that cute laugh out of you by cracking a silly joke, running around the city while doing cute stuff 
             together, and staying up wayyy to late into the night till the sun comes up and waiting for you to come back from your starbies runs 
             so I can spend even more time with you. I'll never forget my first trip there when we spent it in Miami Beach, that one night after 
             the club I was just feeling so many tingles for you. I knew i wanted to be with you indefinetely after we met. You were so shy and 
             cute hiding behind the telephone booth(You are adorable). And now we have evolved to where we still stay up all night but your in 
             my arms now and we go to get starbies together. And together with you is my favorite place to be, you truly are my home. One whole 
             year down, and endless more to come of me and you. Thank you for giving me the love that you give me, after receiving it, I can never 
             live without it now, You really are the best thing that has ever came into my life. Even though it was unexpected, i'm so glad it worked 
             out the way it did. I know we always went fishing in city for jewels but never would I have thought that I would've caught the gem that 
             is you! You are so sweet, so beautiful, and so strong minded :D I can't wait to continue through this life thing with you by my side as 
             we grow closer as the years go by, until we merge as one. I really see us as Criolet since we both make up half of a whole which is this 
             silly super swag person. I love you! Now, tomorrow, next week, next year, next decade, next century, forever. You are so incredible, and 
             so special and so cool. I can't wait to see you and go to disney with you!! It's gonna be so much fun and we are gonna take so many cute 
             lil pictures on your digital camera. I'm excited for more adventures beyond disney and eventually living together(and getting old together) 
             which would be so awesome! But to end it on a toast (water works) Here is to a year filled with love, joy, and great unexpected memories 
             and to many more to come, I truly am blessed to have you in my life. <a href="/flipbook.html"> Happy First Anniversary</a> my love! 
             I promise that I will always be here by your side and support you in whatever dreams it is that you have. MWUAHHH :*
